# Math Striker — Difficulty Rubric v1

## Overview
Every question receives two difficulty scores (1–6):
- **GlobalDifficulty**: determines which league band the question appears in
- **SkillDifficulty**: determines progression within a single skill track

## Factors Used to Determine Difficulty

| Factor | Weight | D1–D2 | D3–D4 | D5–D6 |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| Number range | 25% | 0–5 or 0–10 | 0–12 or teens | Two-digit, larger |
| Cognitive steps | 25% | 1-step recall | 1-step reasoning | 2+ steps |
| Representation | 15% | Numeric only | Simple visual | Complex visual or word |
| Distractor quality | 15% | Obviously wrong | Plausible | Near-miss (off-by-1) |
| Conceptual load | 20% | Pure fact recall | Apply property | Transfer/equivalence |

## Difficulty Tier Descriptions

### D1 — Entry (Grade 2 basics)
- Single-digit multiplication facts (0–5)
- Division facts within 25
- Identify simple fractions from clear visuals (halves, fourths)
- Recognize repeating patterns
- One-sentence word problems with single operation
- Distractors are clearly wrong (far from answer)

### D2 — Foundation (Grade 2–3)
- Multiplication facts 0–10
- Division facts within 50
- Fraction identification with thirds, sixths
- Skip-counting patterns
- Simple word problems with friendly numbers
- Distractors off by ×2 or +10

### D3 — Developing (Grade 3 core)
- Full multiplication table (0–12)
- Missing factor problems
- Equivalent fractions (halves = fourths)
- Pattern rules (additive)
- Word problems requiring one reasoning step
- Distractors off by ±1 product neighbor

### D4 — Proficient (Grade 3–4)
- Compare products, estimate
- Division with simple remainders
- Fractions on number lines
- Function machines (single operation)
- Two-sentence word problems
- Near-miss distractors

### D5 — Advanced (Grade 4)
- Multi-step multiplication/division
- Interpret remainders in context
- Compare fractions with different denominators
- Two-operation function machines
- Multi-step word problems
- Very close distractors

### D6 — Challenge (Grade 4 stretch)
- Multi-step with mixed operations
- Fraction of a set with non-unit fractions
- Complex pattern reasoning
- Multi-step word problems with irrelevant information
- Expert-level distractors (common misconception traps)

## League-to-Difficulty Mapping

| League | GlobalDifficulty Band |
|--------|----------------------|
| U8 | D1–D2 |
| U10 | D2–D3 |
| U12 | D3–D4 |
| U14 | D4–D5 |
| HS | D5 |
| College | D6 |

## Distribution Target (per domain)

| Difficulty | Target % |
|-----------|---------|
| D1 | 12% |
| D2 | 22% |
| D3 | 25% |
| D4 | 22% |
| D5 | 13% |
| D6 | 6% |

Weighted toward D2–D4 where most gameplay time is spent.
